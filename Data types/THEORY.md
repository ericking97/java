# Data type

Defines the values that a variable can take. In Java we have two categories of data type:

1) Primitive data types.
2) Non-primitive data types.

Because Java is a statically typed language the data type of a variable is known at compile time, this means you should always declare it before you can use it.

## Primitive data types

TLDR

**byte**, **short**, **int** and **long** data types are used for storing whole numbers.

**float** and **double** are used for fractional numbers.

**char** is used for storing characters.

**boolean** is used for variables that holds either true or false.

### Byte
Can hold whole number between -128 and 127.
Mostly used to save memory when you are certain that the numbers would be in the limit specified.

### Short
Greater in size than byte but less than integer.
It range is -32,768 to 32767 and it's used with the same purpose as the byte.

### Int
Same as the two above, it has a wider range:
-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

### Long
It range is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

### Double 
Sufficent for holding 15 decimal digits.

### Float
Sufficent for holding 6 to 7 decimal digits.

### Char
Holds characters.

### Boolean
Holds either true or false.
